Public Speaking Tips and Resources


I am clumsy and always have Murphy's law kicking in for me. I experience glossophobia and stage fright often. I am sharing a few tips which may or may not have happened to me, in no particular order to help you become a better speaker.
Why am I sharing this? Because I am clumsy and have butter fingers.
* Check your teeth for food residue, your nose and nails for chipped nail paint, and your breath, or avoid odor-inducing food an hour before your presentation.
* Take a leak and dump. You will feel relief and a weight lifted off your stomach!
* Have a companion buddy. AV can fail, the computer can crash, or WiFi goes kaput. Your buddy can take over the stage, crack some jokes, or engage the audience with questions in line with the topic.
* Ask your buddy to give you social cues of timeouts, have the code words and hand gestures planned, and make eye contact with them to see their cues.
* If you are wearing a dark outfit, dust those crumbs and croissants remnants off your shirt. It can get shown in high contrast when photographed.
* Photographs and videos are here for eternity. Please be sure to watch out for what to say or mention. You represent your organization and its face when talking as a representative. Run it through a Toastmasters group before speaking outside :) I highly recommend that you join a TM club.
* If you have just gotten off your seat and are wearing a dress or a skirt, ensure the heated chair doesn’t stick the dress in your butthole.
* If you drink water before the presentation starts, please make sure you tuck a bib to catch water spills or wear dry-fit clothing.
* Buy time by sipping water when you need to think and answer questions. If you spill, check the above step on how to avoid spills.
* Spend time in the washroom and use the mirror to validate the above points.
* Have some affirmations, speak to your mind softly, and take a deep breath for a couple of minutes.
* Don't chew the gum while presenting. It may curb your anxiety, but the mic and audience may not like it. I'm not too fond of the sound when the chewing gets to the mic :(
* Spend a few minutes doing a mic check, as you don’t want static sounds reverberating from your lapel mics onto the speakers in the ceiling and echoing. Mic can catch even the smallest sounds. I am sensitive to sounds and screeching that can trigger anxiety and palpitations.
* Some late risers are not in the full form if it's a morning event. Keep the first few minutes light and encourage people to stand, get coffee, do warm-up sessions, or show them funny memes.
* Some may feel sleepy if the session is post-lunch, or the siesta can be precious to them. Start on a light note. Repeat the above step.
* In case of a low quorum, move the chairs out to give the illusion of a fuller room.
* Have four buddies or befriend/bribe *wink* 3-4 people before the session and make them sit in each direction. You can make eye contact with them; that way, you cover the whole room.
* Ensure the room is neither too cold nor too warm. People can lose attention if it’s not the optimum temperature.
* Have a song play in your earphone based on the beats of the speech. Pop music or metal to get the tempo up, Jazz to bring you in the zone before the calming presentation.
* Have a decluttered podium, so you don’t knock off things or spill the tea from an open cup!
* Don't clutter your slides. Use the notes feature to read out the features or practice visual illustrations or a storytelling format.
* If you want to bring a message through your presentation, wear a T-shirt with a caption or tagline suitable for the theme.
* If you have an online presentation, still dress well. Don't wear pajamas under your formal shirt. We can see below the waist sometimes. 
* Don't have a flat voice. Modulate it wisely. When narrating a sensitive or personal experience, a change in tone resonates with your emotions with the audience.
* Close all tabs and processes except the one where the presentation is opened so as not to slow your machine.
* You can store your slides on the cloud to switch up machines and quickly present them if necessary.
* Get a good night's sleep! A presenter who yawns throughout the session will have the entire audience yawning and focusing more on not nodding off!
* Check that skirts are down in the back (ladies) and zippers are up (everyone!).
* Have a beginning/introduction, body, conclusion, or takeaway.
* Be mindful of time.
* Smile because people like happy faces :)

I am getting off my soap box now. Thank you for tuning in. You have survived reading a big bulleted list.
Let me know if these tips help you before your next presentation.
